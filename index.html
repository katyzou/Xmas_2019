Merry Christmas my big peanut! It's our 4th Christmas celebration together:3 This was a great year together, I had my first successful 
engineering internship with a return offer (albeit it wasn't taken, it shows promise!), you got a great new job, we went to Seattle 
and our first out of country trip to Canada together. It was so much fun. And guess what, it's only gonna get better because next year
I'll be graduated with a new job, you'll get promoted, we'll get engaged and move in together! Can't wait for next year to come already>:3 then it's takoyaki and 
chill nights every Friday. We'll crack open some cold bobas, heat up the takoyaki maker, put on some music and work on a project together!
We should build a product together for fun, maybe some sautering maybe some web design for my skincare line, who knows the sky is the limit. 
And on the weekends I'm gonna take pottery classes and set up my own Etsy ceramic shop and call it Katy's Pots...or Big and Small Round and 
Flat Things...the name is still a work in progress obviously. Gentle Chili Flake Shop. And on Sunday mornings, it's farmer's market time! I'll 
go get some fresh veggie and fruits (or as mike says: green thingy, orange boi, etc). Thank you for supporting me and waiting for me to graduate:0
I know you're lonely just as I am:( but it'll be okay soon, I'm worth it ;P ‚ù§</p>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER  style="font-family:humble">
  Forever yours, Katy
</h2>
